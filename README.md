# FFmpeg-TKinter-8mb-Compressor-GUI <br/>
This project combines TKinter and FFmpeg so that a user can easily compress files down to 8mb for use with discord <br/>
Files that have been tested are as follows: MP4, M4V, MOV, JPG, PNG <br/>
Other types of video files may work but have not been tested<br/>
The software allows you to compress the file down to 8mb or 50mb. As PNGs are lossless the program attempts its best to compress the file<br/>
All of the code is written in Python<br/>
